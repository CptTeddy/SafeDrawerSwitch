# This is the Drawer Switch app
The Android app of the **[Inivisible Drawer Lock](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0wxzOB6KfTfcEprX3VLMWV0RkU/view?usp=sharing)** project built for Robotics@Berkeley's Dorm Ex Machina (Dorm of the Machine) competition ***(Won Second Place! Yay)***. The app can send on/off request to an Arduino device via bluetooth.

## What is Invisible Drawer Lock
An alerting device that can message your phone if someone opens your drawer without your permission. You need to put the hardware (Arduino plus Wifi, Bluetooth and sensor) in your drawer, and turn on the device with the Drawer Switch app on your Android phone after closing your drawer. Then just wait for any alerts about your roommate trying to sneak your snacks in the drawer!
